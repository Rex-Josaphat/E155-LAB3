# E155 Lab 3

This repository includes the code to explore how to use an FPGA to scan inputs from a keypad. This involves using Finite State Machine Logic to deal with phenomena like switch bouncing and synchronizing async. inputs. The lab also leverages time-multiplexing since the numbers have to be displayed on a dual 7-segment display.
